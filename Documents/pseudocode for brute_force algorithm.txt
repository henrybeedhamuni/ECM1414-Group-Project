pseudocode for brute_force algorithm

n = number of activites
ids = [0, 1, …,n-1]
cheapest cost = minimum activity.cost over activites
max_length = min(n, floor(budget /cheapest_cost))
best_solution = {combination: [], cost: 0, time: 0, enjoyment:0}

For length from max_length down to 2:
	for each combination of ids of size length:
		set cost = 0, time = 0, enjoyment = 0
		for each i combination:
			cost += activities[i].cost
			time += activities[i].duration
			enjoyment += activities[i].enjoyment_level
			if cost >= budget or time >= max_time:
				break out from the inner loop(skip this combination)
		if cost <= budget or time <= max_time and enjoyment > best_solution.enjoyment:
			update best_solution with current combination, cost, time, enjoyment
return best_solution
