# Todo list

## Howard

- 4.4 | Explaining both algorithms, pseudocode, Comparing performance
- 7 | Brute force: explain & evaluate, pseudocode, time complexity -> grows exponentialy ~ not coding algorithm
- 7.2 | Dynamic programming: pseudocode and explain intuition, approach is more efficient ~ assisting on algorithm
- 9.1 | Written Report , Testing
- 9.4 | Presentation
  Essentially documentation, design, and theory

## Henry

- ✅ File scructure
- ✅ Input files
- Get input files importing into python
- Write about how dynamic works and make pseodocode
- ✅ Make dynamic programming implementation in `dynamic.py`

## Boran

- ✅ Make Brute force implemenation in `brute_force.py` (In colaboration with Theo)
- ✅ Write about how brute-force works and make psedocode

## Theo

- ✅ Help collaborate for brute force with Boran
- ✅Help Howard with presentation
- ✅ Help Howard with Documentation
- ✅Completed Enhanced Brute Force(Dual Constraints)

## Steve

- Extensions

## Undivided

- Readme
- Pytest
