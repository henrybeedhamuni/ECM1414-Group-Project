# Todo list

## Howard


- 4.4 | Explaining both algorithms, pseudocode, Comparing performance
- 7 | Brute force: explain & evaluate, pseudocode, time complexity -> grows exponentialy
- 7.2 | Dynamic programming: pseudocode and explain intuition, approach is more efficient
- 9.1 | Written Report , Testing 
- 9.4 | Presentation 
- Assistance on Dynamic Programming

## Henry

- ✅ File scructure
- ✅ Input files
- Get input files importing into python
- Write about how dynamic works and make pseodocode
- Make dynamic programming implementation in `dynamic.py`

## Boran
